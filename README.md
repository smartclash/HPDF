# HPDF Project

This repository contains all the completed projects that were assigned to me as a part of the HPDF tasks. You can view documentation on how to run each project (task) inside the folder of each project.

### Structure

Each folder represents a project associated with a task. Each folder (project) has a `README` which instructs on how to run the project on your system. 

### Global requirements

These underlaying things are important to be installed in your system. These requirements applies to every project. If in case any project requires anything more - it will be specified in the specific project's `README`

- Node >= 9.2.0
- NPM >= 4.0.0
- Yarn >= 1.3.2 (Recommended as an alternative to NPM)
